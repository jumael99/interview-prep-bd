1. DBMS fundamental concepts
2. OOP concepts
3. Halka OS and Networking (stuff like deadlock, OSI model etc)
4. Programming language fundamentals
5. Basic data structures and algorithms
6. Practice a lot in leetcode.
7. Overall understanding of anything that you mentioned in your resume. And I'm assuming you have a couple of projects to show. The quality of the projects isn't that important unless it's something super impressive.
8. A well formatted resume. Don't make it too text heavy or too fancy. Basically, don't make it hard to read within a minute.
The sections are in no particular order. You have one full year. That's a lot of time to cover all this. Best of luck!
